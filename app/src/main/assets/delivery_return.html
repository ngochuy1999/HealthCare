    All orders placed on SnapShop are fulfilled directly by the merchant. Terms vary as each
    merchant sets their own Delivery &amp; Returns options. Most sellers ship internationally and offer
    returns, however you should check full details in the Delivery &amp; Returns section on the product
    page or the About section on the merchants boutique page.</p>
<p>
    Each order is unique, so shipping costs will vary depending on the size, weight and destination
    of your chosen items. If you purchase multiple items from different sellers, you must choose a
    separate delivery option from each seller at checkout.
</p>
<p>
    Most orders placed on SnapShop are delivered Monday to Saturday (excluding public holidays).
</p>
<p>
    Please keep in mind that our shipping and delivery times should be used as a guide only and
    may vary on time from dispatch. SnapShop will not be responsible for any customs clearance,
    delays or failed payment approval, however we will try to minimise any delays.
